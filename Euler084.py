# Solution to Project Euler problem 84.

# Algorithm: I basically tried to straightforwardly implement the complex rules stated in the problem.
# Then, because we're interested in a statistical solution, I just let the game play for lots of moves.

# Finally, for debugging, it helps that we're given the correct solutions for 6-sided dice,
# plus the reminder that the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, and the probability of ending on G2J is zero.

# Note that this program yields the wrong result for the fourth most common square for 6 dice,
# namely 19 instead of 00.
# However, given how much time I've spent on this problem, and how ambiguous its description is,
# I'm not interested in debugging it any longer. After all, the main result is correct.


# Rules for Euler Monopoly (as I understand them):
#
# Begin at square zero (GO).
# Roll two six- / four-sided dice and add the result.
# Move based on the result of the dice throw:
# - Normal square: Nothing happens.
# - G2J square: Go to jail, end turn. (We don't skip a turn in jail because that wouldn't affect the probabilities.)
# - CC square: Move according to the top card of the CH deck, then put the card to the bottom.
# - CH square: Move according to the top card of the Chance deck, then put the card to the bottom.
# - If your dice throw was the first or second double (Pasch), take another turn. May not if you're in jail; unsure.
# - Same after the second double.
# - If not in jail and it's the third double, go to jail immediately instead of taking another turn.
